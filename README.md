# Chao-Pi-Adventure
A Tamagotchi like based on the old "Chao Adventure" VMU for Dreamcast.

You can play it on a Rapsberry Pi Zero with an Adafruit 1.3' OLED Bonnet or a WaveShare 2.13' V2 E-Paper screen. (This are the only two ones i have at the moment,tweaking the code to make it work on other screens is easily doable)
Terminal mode is available, but no menu/buttons support at the moment. (The Chao can still walk around, getting items and ageing)
